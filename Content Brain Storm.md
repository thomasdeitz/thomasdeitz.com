### Lean UX Process
My process is in general fexible being that I work with a number of different type of clients that span multiple markets and sizes. In general I use a lean approach facilitating short pointed excercises designed to balance insight and efficiency. Low fidelity assets, photos of whiteboards and code serve as my documentation for the most part though I am glad to do high resolution renderings, jopournaey maps and other UX related assets if that is the right direction for the client. I am a fan of getting something 90% of the way thre and getting it in front of users than I am of noodling something for months to get it "100%" of the way there to learn that I missed the boat and we need to back track quite a bit. Fail fast and pivot.

In the first 1-2 weeks of the project we will spend time getting the project and environments setup as well as participate in a number of UX activities that will really inform the direction the site will take as we move forward into development. This may include proto-persona creation, workflows, journey maps and design sessions. After this we can begin reimagining the experience a user has as they move through your site visually and with regard to the content they encounter. As we approach some of the more strategic changes to the Calculator and the Acquisition Process we may engage in some similar activities on a smaller scale to ensure we are on the same page and moving forward in a smart direction.

I take a lean user focused approach to software development with just enough of each ingredient that a project needs to achieve the end goal in an effort to maximize efficiency and minimize waste. Users and outcomes are prioritized over documentation and mockups. that is nit to say I DONT VALUE ABEAUTIFUL AND FULLFILLING EXPERIENCE Ijust think the best way to get there is to build something for some one and see how they use it and keep what works for them and iterate on the parts that dont.
