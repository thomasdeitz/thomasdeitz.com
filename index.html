                    I am a seasoned UX leader passionate about guiding agile teams to efficiently solve design problems
                    that yield delightful experiences for the end user. Taking a user problem from felt need, to
                    design, to front-end code, to a validated solution is my bread and butter.

                    Throughout my career I have been a part of teams in small and large organizations and delight in new
                    challenges. I have most recently been a Senior User Experience Contractor for a couple interesting organizations in Milwaukee and Orange County.

                    When I am not working you very well might find me wiping out on my road bike, messing around with
                    music in my home studio, serving at church, spending time with my family, or just cuddling with
                    my dog.
